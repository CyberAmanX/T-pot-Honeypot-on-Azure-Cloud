#  T-Pot Honeypot Deployment on Azure VM

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment and configuration of **[T-Pot Honeypot](https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce)** on an **Azure Cloud Virtual Machine**.

T-Pot is a **multi-honeypot platform** integrating several honeypot technologies (e.g., Cowrie, Dionaea, Elastihoney, etc.) into a single environment. It provides researchers, defenders, and cybersecurity learners with real-world attack data and insights.

By deploying it on **Azure Cloud Infrastructure**, this project focuses on:

* 📊 Collecting live attack telemetry
* 🕵️‍♂️ Understanding attacker TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures)
* ⚡ Building hands-on skills in **Threat Intelligence & Honeypot Management**
* ☁️ Leveraging cloud scalability to host and monitor honeypots effectively


## 🚀 Features of the Deployment

* ✅ **T-Pot Community Edition (latest release)** installation on Ubuntu Server
* ✅ **Azure Cloud VM** configuration (networking, security groups, firewall rules)
* ✅ Centralized **ELK Stack Dashboard** for visualization
* ✅ Integrated honeypot services: Cowrie, Dionaea, Conpot, ADBHoney, etc.
* ✅ Secure remote access and monitoring setup
* ✅ Documentation of installation steps, troubleshooting, and dashboards
